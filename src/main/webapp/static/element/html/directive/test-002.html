		public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username)
			throws UsernameNotFoundException, DataAccessException;

	org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails

	<authentication-manager>

Spring Security ACL module

domain object security
	Example: Carrier should be able to see HE/MO page, but should ony be seeing its own URL's

	deciding factors
	1. the actor
	2. the domain object being acted upon
	3. the requested action

	-ask the access-question in terms of permissions: 
		does the actor have permission to perform the action on the domain object?
	-Spring Security addresses this need by giving each secure-domain-object (such as a gradebook) an access-control-list (ACL). Each ACL is an ordered list of access rules, or access-control-entries (ACEs). An ACE specifies for a given (domain-object, actor, action) triple whether to grant or block the action.
	-Spring Security ACL module employs an ACE inheritance mechanism to keep the ACEs manageable even as the number of domain objects grows
	-Example:
		Suppose that we have a forum with 10,000 messages. 
		The forum moderator needs admin access to all 10,000 messages. 
		Instead of creating 10,000 ACEs, we simply link the messages to the forum and create a single ACE giving the moderator admin access to the forum. The messages will inherit their ACEs from the forum as a result, and the moderator now has admin access to the messages.

Only users with the write or admin permission can edit a message:
<!-- -->
@PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#message, write) or hasPermission(#message, admin)")
public void editMessage(Message message) { ... }


Only users with the admin role or permission can read blocked messages:
@PostAuthorize("hasRole('admin') or hasPermission(filterObject, admin)")
public Message getMessage(long id) { ... }
